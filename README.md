# 💻 Giyah Land Online Shop  

## 📖 About Project

**Giyah Land** is an online store developed using **JavaScript** and **TailwindCSS**.

This project was a valuable learning experience and involved several real-world challenges,  
including building a **fully responsive design**, managing **shopping cart logic**,  
handling application logic with vanilla JavaScript, and creating **reusable UI components**  
to keep the codebase clean and scalable.

The project is connected to a **Back-End API** for handling dynamic data  
such as products, users, and orders.

The main goal of this project was to build a modern online store for **selling plants and pots**,  
while strengthening my practical front-end development skills.
